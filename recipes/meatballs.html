    <h2>Chicken Meatballs - Moral Dilemma Sold Separately</h2>

    <p>
      I've had a lot of turkey and chicken meatballs over the years, and
      virtually none of them were good. Keep in mind, I'm really not that picky,
      and easily impressed, but halfway through one of these usually dry, oddly
      textured balls, I'd always be wondering why they didn't just use some nice
      fatty, red meat. Well, that wasn't the case here. These were as good as
      any meatballs I've made, or eaten, in a very long time.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
      <li>3 ounces pork fat, or fatty bacon, diced</li>
      <li>3 ounces crumbled fresh French breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>⅓ cup sautéed onions (Optional)</li>

      <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon white wine</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped parsley</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon chili flakes</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon fennel seeds, crushed</li>
      <li>4 cups prepared tomato sauce (Optional)</li>
      <li>olive oil or cooking spray for greasing baking sheet</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix chicken and pork together on a plate or tray, and place in the
        freezer for about 15 minutes, or until firm and very cold. Partially
        frozen is okay.
      </li>
      <li></li>
      <li>
        Add breadcrumbs to the bowl of a food processor (this should be crumbled
        from the inside of a loaf of fresh or day old French bread – no crust!).
        Add sauteed onions, egg, white wine, garlic, parsley, salt, pepper,
        chili flakes, and crushed fennel seeds. Add chilled chicken mixture on
        top.
      </li>
      <li></li>
      <li>
        Pulse on and off in the food processor as shown until the mixture
        resembles ground meat. Stopping occasionally and scraping the bowl of
        food processor during the process is recommended.
      </li>
      <li></li>
      <li>Transfer mixture to fridge and chill for 1 hour before shaping.</li>
      <li></li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
        with foil and lightly grease with olive oil.
      </li>
      <li></li>
      <li>
        Divide mixture into 12 portions, and place on the prepared baking sheet.
        Use damp hands to roll into smooth balls.
      </li>
      <li></li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are cooked through, about 18
        minutes. For some additional browning, turn broiler to high, and broil
        meatballs for 1 to 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li></li>
      <li>
        Meatballs can be served immediately, or transferred into tomato sauce
        set over low heat. Simmer gently for about 20 minutes to flavor sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
